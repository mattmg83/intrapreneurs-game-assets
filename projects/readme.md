## Projects

Each project card contains two levels of investment and their matching rewards: Minimally Viable and Transformative.
Project cards come in 3 main families: Configuration, Offering, and Experience, that all produce rewards of any 2 types:
• Growth
• and Growth Fuel
A player can pause a project to free the asset cards that were allocated to it but the ”pause” cost
is an added burden if they choose to later restart it. For example this: would
mean that restarting this project after a pause would cost an additional Tailwind   .
Starting a new project costs a turn, allocating more assets to existing projects to upgrade them does not and can be done anytime.

When a project is at its _“Minimally Viable”_ level, the asset cards are placed under the project card to the left side; 
When it reaches its _Transformative_ state the asset cards are shifted to the right side
   
Project can also have acceleration potential, marked by the symbol   . If a player has an active project with an acceleration condition AND the matching acceleration card [regardless of which project the card is allocated to], as noted on the project, they may receive extra rewards at the end of the game, as listed on the project card. Use the acceleration tokens to remind yourself of these extras.
