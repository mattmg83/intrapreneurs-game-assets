chits to use for easier tracking of in-game perks and bonuses (accelerators and defense tokens)

## Option 1

Play with the full set of chits to keep track of the particular card each is associated with

## Option 2

Play with the blank / unmarked chits to make it simpler and use them as a simple reminder that you have some defense or accelerator tokens available
