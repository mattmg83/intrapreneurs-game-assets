### About PlayingCards.io

The platform on which the game can be played is free and allows multiplayer sessions, but doesn't provide advanced features, such that:
 - Players should use a separate chat or live voice/video messaging (zoom, meet.jit.si, discord, etc.)
 - Players should know the rules, as the platform doesn't enforce them, and therefore it is up to the players to ensure they are following them and playing according to the intended design of the game
 - Players should self-manage the turns

### About

This game was created as an academic support for a strategy / innovation class I teach to MBA students, and occasionally for professional development workshops. Rules are fairly comprehensive and the game is designed to be balanced/equitable while also allowing for many teachable moments relatable to real world working experience, but edge cases not addressed in the rulebook do occasionally appear in games, the recommended approach is to make up a rule based on common sense and trying to mimick real-world business.

Below are some examples of in-game rules and their real-world inspiration:
 - The hand size maximum of 7 cards is based on the fact that hoarding resources without using them for projects would not be tolerated in a real business and one would be required to either allocate the assets and resources they hold or to forgo them
 - The Open Innovation Cards (purple asset cards) only start appearing in round 2, because in earlier stages of an innovation journey they would be unrealistic. Similarly all cards are sequenced across the 3 rounds in a logical progression.
 - The macro events affect all players and are random by nature (some good, some bad, some unfair), as they would in the real-world
